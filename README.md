## Development Roadmap

This is a list of current development goals for this project:

- Feature parity with [Tuya Cloud Vacuum Map Extractor](https://github.com/oven-lab/tuya_cloud_map_extractor)
- Automated tests for each supported device

## Development Environment

It's recommended to set up a development environment if you want to make changes to this component.

### Prerequisites

- [A Visual Studio Code + devcontainer development environment](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_environment)

### Getting Started

1. Once the devcontainer is created, fork this repository.
2. Go to the folder containing the `homeassistant-core` folder, it should be called `workspaces`.
3. Once your fork is created, make sure your terminal path is set to `/workspaces` and run `git clone <url>`.
4. To make testing easier, create a symlink to the component in your Home Assistant devcontainer.
   - Example: `ln -s /workspaces/tuya-vacuum-maps/custom_components/tuya_vacuum_maps /workspaces/homeassistant-core/config/custom_components`
5. For development, it's recommended you use a virtual environment.
   1. Create a new virtual environment (Run in the root `/tuya-vacuum-maps` folder):
      - `python -m venv venv`
   2. Activate the virtual environment:
      - `source ./venv/bin/activate`
